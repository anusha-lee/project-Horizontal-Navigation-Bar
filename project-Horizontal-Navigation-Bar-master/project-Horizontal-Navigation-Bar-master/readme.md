# Code Adventure Navigation 

Create a horizontal navigation bar in this fun Code Adventure. We've provided a mockup for you to follow, or if you're up to the challenge, create your own layout and styles. Feel free to add whatever you'd like to this navigation bar - whether it is HTML, CSS, or JavaScript functionality. 

## Getting started 

  
1. Review the mockup.png file inside of the images folder
  - This mockup is for those who want a visual representation to follow along with. You are more than welcome to add your own styling and layout.
  
2. Open up index.html file
  - There's some HTML stater code, but you'll need to link the stylesheet, and add the HTML for the navigation bar.

3. Open the style.css file inside the css folder
  - Add your styles to this file to make the navigation bar look awesome. (Don't forget to link this to the HTML file). 
  
  
## Tasks

- Add HTML elements to the index.html file
  - Home image. Use the treehouse-logo.png file in the images folder, or find or create your own image for the navigation bar.
  - Unordered list with list items for navigation items
  
- Style your navigation bar by adding CSS to the style.css file
  
  
### Take this project further

If you want to do even more, here are a couple of ideas to expand on this code adventure
- Add a CSS hover effect when a navigation item is moused over
- Add a CSS transistion effect with hover effect
- Add additional HTML pages to link up the navigation bar to actual pages
